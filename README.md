# Such Quick Tiles

Custom Quick Settings Tiles for Android 6.0 Marshmallow and CyanogenMod devices with CM Platform SDK 2.

## What about it?
What it does do and not do
- Create tile
    - Click/long click action (no long click on CM)
        - App launcher
        - Shortcut
    - Tile Icon
        - AOSP, currently only bundled resources
        - CM, AOSP + drawable support, ie. app icons, custom icons not implemented (yet)
- Delete tile
    - Via System UIs, in app delete not implemented
- Recreate tiles on after device reboot

### What could a tile possibly do?
Pretty much anything one could do with a regular app. A tile click just fires of a BroadcastReceiver where all the heavy lifting is done.
